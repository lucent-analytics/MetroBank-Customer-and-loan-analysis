# 🏦 MetroBank Customer & Loan Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of MetroBank’s customer and loan data. Multiple datasets were joined to create a unified view of customers and their loan activities. The analysis explores customer demographics, borrowing behavior, loan distribution, and repayment patterns to uncover insights that support data-driven decision-making in banking operations.

By combining customer-level and loan-level data, this project enables a deeper understanding of how different customer segments interact with loan products and how these behaviors impact credit risk and overall portfolio performance.
